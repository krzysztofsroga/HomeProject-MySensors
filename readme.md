HomeProject-MySensors
---

This project is a bridge between Domoticz, PCF8574 port expander and PCA9685 servo driver.
Light buttons should be connected to Arduino Mega pins. 
AC relays should be connected to PCF expanders
LED lights should be connected to PCA drivers through MOSFET transistors.

This project has been successfully driving my smart home for two years.
